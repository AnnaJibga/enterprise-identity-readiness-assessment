# Changelog

All notable changes to the Enterprise Identity Readiness Assessment will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-13

Naming and canonical-reference alignment. No change to dimensions, statements, weights, score ranges, or scoring logic. Scores produced under v1.0 remain valid and comparable.

### Changed

- Dimension 3 renamed from Institutional Logic Codification to **Institutional Logic Digitalization**, matching the canonical instrument at [foundeon.com/eira](https://foundeon.com/eira).
- Readiness interpretation renamed from bands to **segments**, and the four segments renamed from READY, PROGRESSING, AT RISK, URGENT to **Ready, Progressing, Emerging, Foundational**. Segment descriptions rewritten to state what the score means and what the work ahead is.
- Methodology context updated to current DSIL™ language. The earlier five-stage description is retired.
- Canonical methodology home and all contact addresses updated to Foundeon.
- Assessment workbook updated in place. The filename `enterprise-identity-readiness-assessment-v1.0.xlsx` is retained as a stable download path, so existing links continue to resolve.

### Added

- Reference to the Workflow Disposition Framework (WDF™), which uses the assessment result as its readiness input.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-28

Initial public release of the Enterprise Identity Readiness Assessment as a standalone, citable repository.

### Added

- Excel assessment workbook (`enterprise-identity-readiness-assessment-v1.0.xlsx`) with six weighted dimensions, eighteen statements, automated scoring, and four-band interpretation
- README documenting the purpose, audience, dimensions, and use of the assessment
- SCORING_METHODOLOGY.md explaining the dimension structure, weighting rationale, and band diagnostics
- EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md providing a fully completed sample assessment with leadership-level interpretation
- ABOUT.md establishing what the assessment is for, what it isn't for, the assumptions it makes, and the IP context
- LICENSE.md applying CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 with plain-language summary, commercial licensing path, and trademark notice
- CITATION.cff for formal citation in research, advisory work, and institutional reporting
- This CHANGELOG

### Notes on prior distribution

The assessment was previously available as a downloadable resource at <https://foundationaldataproducts.com/tools>. The GitHub release establishes a formally versioned, citable, IP-anchored distribution. The website version and the GitHub v1.0 release are content-equivalent.

### Methodology context

This release is the diagnostic entry point to the DSIL™ framework. Digital Substrate Identity Layer / DSIL™ is Foundeon's proprietary method for making enterprise meaning, policy context, decision rights, governance expectations, and accountability explicit before AI systems consume them. The assessment makes the institutional articulation gap visible. The methodology closes it.

## Versioning policy

The assessment will follow semantic versioning:

- **Major versions (2.0, 3.0, ...)** indicate substantive structural changes: adding or removing dimensions, materially changing the weighting structure, or revising the segment interpretation framework.
- **Minor versions (1.1, 1.2, ...)** indicate refinements to statement language, weight calibration based on field use, naming alignment, or clarifications to the interpretation guidance.
- **Patch versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, ...)** indicate corrections to typos, formatting, or non-substantive updates.

Each release will be tagged in the GitHub repository and accompanied by release notes documenting the changes and the rationale.
